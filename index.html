			<h2>Foundation Purpose</h2>

			<p>The Oliphant Educational Fund was created to establish a scholarship program that invests in the Oliphant community, inspires future teachers and contributes to growth and opportunities for Oliphant District graduates. To be considered for a Oliphant Educational Fund scholarship, applicants must be accepted into the Professional Teacher Preparation Program at Arizona State University, College of Teacher Education and Leadership. The applicant must be attending classes and gaining field experience in the Oliphant Elementary School District.</p>

			<h2>What is the Need?</h2>


			<img src="images/az-flag-300w.png" alt="Arizona Flag">

			<p>	
				With Teacher shortages in Arizona and nation-wide, the Oliphant District strives to ensure a highly qualified teacher serves students in every classroom.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Oliphant District is located in the East Side of Morrisville and serves families in Morrisville, Littleton and Carsondale. The District has grown rapidly in the past 15 years, increasing from 6,000 students to nearly 10,000 students in the 2009-2010 school year. The District has 14 elementary schools.
			</p>

			<p>
				An increasing number of families in the District have income at or below the poverty level, with more than 50% qualifying for free or reduced cost lunch programs. Five schools will qualify as Title 1 schools according to federal guidelines. Overall income, both household and per capita in the Oliphant District is lower than the Morrisville Metro Area.
			</p>

			<p>
				While the District currently has more than 600 certified teachers, cultivating highly qualified teachers from within our own community is an investment back to the community.

			<h2>Who Will Benefit?</h2>

			<img src="images/graduate-820w-bt.jpg" alt="graduate">

			<p>
				The scholarship program is an investment in the East Side of Morrisville, and the Oliphant community, with students and families the primary recipients of the efforts of the Oliphant Educational Fund. Scholarships are awarded to help East Side education students complete their degree program and provide incentive to teach in the Oliphant School District and other East Side schools. The community profits by a program designed to promote higher education and to encourage graduates to return to Oliphant as teachers and contributors.
