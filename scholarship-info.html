			<p>The scholarship program is an investment in the East Side of Morrisville, and the Oliphant community, with students and families the primary recipients of the efforts of the Oliphant Educational Fund.  Scholarships are awarded to help East Side education students complete their degree program and provide incentive to teach in the Oliphant School District and other East Side schools. The community profits by a program designed to promote higher education and to encourage graduates to return to Oliphant as teachers and contributors.</p>

			<p>The Oliphant District serves families in Morrisville, Littleton and Avondale.  The District has 10,000 students attending 14 elementary schools.  There are 600 certified teachers in the District.</p>

			<p>Based upon a selection process, the Oliphant Educational Fund will award a number of tuition scholarships to aspiring teachers who are accepted into the Professional Development School (PDS) program, a partnership of the Oliphant Elementary School District and Arizona State University (West).  The PDS program is an accelerated, 18 month degree program that provides intensive student teaching and classroom experiences.  Because of the time commitment, most PDS students are unable to work during their classes and need financial assistance.</p>
